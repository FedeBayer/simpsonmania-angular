        Did It", in which they point out that The Simpsons got the idea from the 1962 television series The Twilight
        area,
        especially from the episode titled "The Little People." There are also similarities to the 1941 short story
        Microcosmic God. The elections
        The 1996 presidential elections took place just days after this episode aired. According to Cohen, the
        segment "Citizen Kang"
        broke all the rules of The Simpsons at once and named specific candidates. The sequence in the
